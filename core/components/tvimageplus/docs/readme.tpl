Advanced image TV input type for MODx Revolution.
The required dimensions for the image can (optionally) 
be configured on the TV, restricting one or both 
dimensions. When the editor uploads an image to the TV,
they can then use a graphical tool to crop the image
to the required dimensions/proportions.
