## Advanced Image Custom Template Variable

Advanced image custom template variable type for MODx Revolution. The dimensions for the uploaded image can (optionally) 
be configured to constrain a minimal width and/or height. The image crop could be forced to remain at a pre-set ratio. 
A graphical tool could be used to crop the image to the required dimensions/proportions.
